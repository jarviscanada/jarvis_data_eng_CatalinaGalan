summary: "I am a deeply curious individual and a dedicated lifelong learner. With a background in the arts and music, I earned my bachelor's degree in Music Composition, graduating with Great Distinction. In 2023 I successfully completed a Web Development bootcamp and have been continuing to learn and collaborate in projects ever since. Fascinated by both the arts and sciences, I continually seek opportunities to challenge my abilities and foster intellectual growth. My interest in software development stems from a strong desire to expand my knowledge and pursue a new, challenging career path.
