# Introduction
This Java grep app is designed to mimic the function of the Linux grep cmd. It looks 
for a matching string within a file (or files) in a given directory. 
It will return all the lines that match the given pattern.
The grep app was implemented using core java, java util,  slf4j and log4j logger,  IntelliJ IDE, 
Apache Maven and Docker.
