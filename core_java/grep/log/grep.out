  In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:
  In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:  
  In one of thine, from that which thou departest,
  In thy soul's thought (all naked) will bestow it:
  Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
  In our two loves there is but one respect,
  Injurious distance should not stop my way,
  In tender embassy of love to thee,
  In winged speed no motion shall I know,
    In all external grace you have some part,
  In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
  Increasing store with loss, and loss with store.
    In days long since, before these last so bad.
  In him those holy antique hours are seen,
  In other accents do this praise confound
  In me thou seest the twilight of such day,
  In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,
  In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
  In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend.
  In whose confine immured is the store,
  In polished form of well refined pen.
    In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.
  In many's looks, the false heart's history
  In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
  In gentle numbers time so idly spent,
  In process of the seasons have I seen,
  In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights,
  Incertainties now crown themselves assured,
  In so profound abysm I throw all care
    Incapable of more, replete with you,
  In the distraction of this madding fever!
  In the old age black was not counted fair,
    In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,
  In things of great receipt with case we prove,
    In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,
  In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,  
  In pursuit of the thing she would have stay:
  In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
  In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,
  In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
  In a cold valley-fountain of that ground:
  COUNTESS. In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.

    In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man

    Indeed my mother! Or were you both our mothers,

    In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,

    In that and all your worthiest affairs.
    In argument of praise, or to the worth
    In the unlawful purpose.
    In honestest defence.
    In any staining act.
    In most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire,
    In fine, delivers me to fill the time,

    In me to lose.

    In what we can, to bridle and suppress
    In the cathedral church of Westminster,  
    In courage, courtship, and proportion;
    In England work your Grace's full content.
    Injurious Duke, that threatest where's no cause.
    Invite my Lords of Salisbury and Warwick
    In thine own person answer thy abuse.
    In my opinion yet thou seest not well.
    In this close walk to satisfy myself
    In craving your opinion of my tide,
    In sight of God and us, your guilt is great;
  YORK. In your protectorship you did devise
    In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
    In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble.
    In life but double death,'now Gloucester's dead.

    Under the which is writ 'Invitis nubibus.'

  KING HENRY. In any case be not too rough in terms,
  YORK. In all submission and humility
    For shame! In duty bend thy knee to me,
    Into as many gobbets will I cut it
    In cruelty will I seek out my fame.
    In following this usurping Henry.
    In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.  
  CLIFFORD. In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
    In them I trust, for they are soldiers,
    Intend here to besiege you in your castle.
  CLIFFORD. In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood
    In blood of those that had encount'red him.
    In this the heaven figures some event.
    In haste post-haste are come to join with you;
    In every borough as we pass along;
    Inferring arguments of mighty force.
    In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,
    Instead whereof let this supply the room.
    In this self-place where now we mean to stand.
    Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
    Not deck'd with diamonds and Indian stones,
  KING HENRY. In God's name, lead; your King's name be obey'd;
  WARWICK. Injurious Margaret!
    In them and in ourselves our safety lies.
  CLARENCE. In choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment,
    Into this chiefest thicket of the park.
    In secret ambush on the forest side
  MONTGOMERY. What talk you of debating? In few words:
  WARWICK. In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
    In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.
  CLARENCE. In sign of truth, I kiss your Highness' hand.
    In every county as we go along.
    Infuse his breast with magnanimity
    Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;
    In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,
    In their embracement, as they grew together;
    Made Britain India: every man that stood
    In honour honesty, the tract of ev'rything
    In such a business.
    Into a general prophecy-that this tempest,
    In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advis'd.
    Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally-
    That gentleman of Buckingham's. In person
    In loud rebellion.
    The nature of it? In what kind, let's know,
    In tempting of your patience, but am bold'ned
    In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,
  SANDYS. He may, my lord; has wherewithal. In him  
    In all this noble bevy, has brought with her
    In their fair cheeks, my lord; then we shall have 'em
    Into our presence, where this heaven of beauty
    In the next chamber.
    In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.
    Into what pitch he please.
    Into my private meditations?
    Invited by your noble self, hath sent
    In the unpartial judging of this business.
    In this man's place before him?
  OLD LADY. In faith, for little England
    In our long absence. Pray, do not deliver
    In what have I offended you? What cause
    Induc'd by potent circumstances, that
    In any of their courts.           Exeunt QUEEN and her attendants
    In humblest manner I require your Highness
    Induce you to the question on't, or ever
        In sweet music is such art,
    Into your private chamber, we shall give you
    In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,
    In truth I know not. I was set at work
  QUEEN KATHARINE. In England
    In mine own country, lords.
    In the divorce his contrary proceedings
    In mind and feature. I persuade me from her
    In it be memoriz'd.
    In the King's business.
    His eye against the moon. In most strange postures
    Into our hands, and to confine yourself  
    In time will find their fit rewards. That seal
    Into your own hands, Cardinal, by extortion;
    Install'd Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.
    In that one woman I have lost for ever.
    In all my miseries; but thou hast forc'd me,
    In celebration of this day with shows,
    Our king has all the Indies in his arms,
    In a rich chair of state, opposing freely
    In the old time of war, would shake the press,
    Invite me to a banquet; whose bright faces
  KATHARINE. In which I have commended to his goodness
    In all humility unto his Highness;
    In them a wilder nature than the business
    Incens'd the lords o' th' Council, that he is-
    In the great'st humbleness, and desir'd your Highness
    In us, thy friend. Give me thy hand, stand up;
    In charging you with matters, to commit you,
    In our own natures frail and capable
    In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,
    In seeking tales and informations
    In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince;
    In such an honour; how may I deserve it,
    strange Indian with the great tool come to court, the
    Into whose hand I give thy life.
    In her days every man shall eat in safety
    In my behaviour to the majesty,
    In the large composition of this man?
    In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
    In sooth, he might; then, if he were my brother's,
    In at the window, or else o'er the hatch;
    In such a just and charitable war.
    In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits  
    And this is Geffrey's. In the name of God,
    In any breast of strong authority
    In right of Arthur, do I claim of thee;
    Infortunate in nothing but in thee.
    In warlike march these greens before your town,
    In the relief of this oppressed child
    In that behalf which we have challeng'd it;
  CITIZEN. In brief: we are the King of England's subjects;
    In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king!
    In best appointment all our regiments.
    In this hot trial more than we of France;
    In undetermin'd differences of kings.
  KING JOHN. In us that are our own great deputy
    Into this city's bosom.
    In mortal fury half so peremptory
    In titles, honours, and promotions,
    In such a love so vile a lout as he.
    This widow lady? In her right we came;
    And from Pope Innocent the legate here,
    Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.  
    In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.
    In the vile prison of afflicted breath.
    In the fair multitude of those her hairs!
    In this which he accounts so clearly won.
  HUBERT. Indeed I have been merrier.
    In sooth, I would you were a little sick,
    In undeserved extremes. See else yourself:
  SALISBURY. In this the antique and well-noted face
  SALISBURY. Indeed, we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
  PEMBROKE. Indeed, we heard how near his death he was,
    Insinuation, parley, and base truce,
    Into the purse of rich prosperity
    In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake
  BASTARD. Indeed, your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
    In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.
    In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence
    In peace, and part this body and my soul
    In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,
    In their continuance will not feel themselves.
    Into the channel, till the lowest stream
  BRUTUS. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
    In awe of such a thing as I myself.
    In several hands, in at his windows throw,
    Incenses them to send destruction.
  CICERO. Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
    In personal action, yet prodigious grown
  CASCA. Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
    In every place save here in Italy.
    In Pompey's Porch. For now, this fearful night,
    In favor's like the work we have in hand,
    In at his window; set this up with wax
  CASCA. Indeed he is not fit.
    In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
    In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
    Into the law of children. Be not fond
    In states unborn and accents yet unknown!  
    In the disposing of new dignities.
    Most noble! In the presence of thy corse?
    In terms of friendship with thine enemies.  
    In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
    Into the marketplace. There shall I try,
    In my oration, how the people take
    Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
    In every wound of Caesar that should move
    In our black sentence and proscription.
    In his own change, or by ill officers,
  CASSIUS. In such a time as this it is not meet
    In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.              Drinks.
  ANTONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
    In Parthia did I take thee prisoner,
    Into his ears. I may say "thrusting" it,
    In our own proper entrails.                     Low alarums.

     Interest of territory, cares of state),
     And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
     In your dear Highness' love.  
     friendship falls off, brothers divide. In cities, mutinies; in  
     In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,
     Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
     Into her womb convey sterility;
     Inform her full of my particular fear,
     Intelligence is given where you are hid.
     In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.
     In his own course.
  Lear. Inform'd them? Dost thou understand me, man?
     Infirmity doth still neglect all office
     Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,
     In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee.
     Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen,
     Into this scattered kingdom, who already,
     In some of our best ports and are at point

     In the restoring his bereaved sense?
     In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him!
     In expectation of them. O dear father,

     In better phrase and matter than thou didst.
  Edg. Y'are much deceiv'd. In nothing am I chang'd

  BEROWNE. In what manner?
  COSTARD. In manner and form following, sir; all those three: I was

    In spending your wit in the praise of mine.

    In pruning me? When shall you hear that I

    In that each of you have forsworn his book,
    In leaden contemplation have found out
    In conflict, that you get the sun of them.

    In Russian habit; here they stayed an hour
    In russet yeas, and honest kersey noes.
    In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
    In the converse of breath- your gentleness
    In their own fashion, like a merriment.
    In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

    In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;

A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron. Thunder.
    In the poison'd entrails throw.
    In the cauldron boil and bake;

    In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon;
    In evils to top Macbeth.
    In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters,
    In nature is a tyranny; it hath been  
    In my most ill-composed affection such

  ISABELLA. In such a one as, you consenting to't,
    In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
    In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
    In precise guards! Dost thou think, Claudio,
    In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
  PROVOST. In good time.                            Exit PROVOST

    In that good path that I would wish it go,
  ANGELO. In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions show much
  DUKE. Relate your wrongs. In what? By whom? Be brief.
    In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,

    In hateful practice. First, his integrity
    In countenance! Heaven shield your Grace from woe,

    In levity. Since which time of five years
    In any chastisement. I for a while will leave you;
  ESCALUS. In very good time. Speak not you to him till we call upon
    In that he did the thing for which he died;
    Intents but merely thoughts.

  PORTIA. In terms of choice I am not solely led
    In way of marriage; therefore be advis'd.
  LAUNCELOT. Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and
  LAUNCELOT. In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as
    In graces, and in qualities of breeding;

    Exceed three days. In faith, he's penitent;
  IAGO. Indeed!  
  OTHELLO. Indeed? ay, indeed. Discern'st thou aught in that?
    In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, "Indeed!"
    In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
    Much will be seen in that. In the meantime,
    Into the vale of years- yet that's not much-
    In sleep I heard him say, "Sweet Desdemona,
    In the due reverence of a sacred vow                      Kneels.
    In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;
  DESDEMONA.                      Indeed! is't true?
  DESDEMONA. In sooth, you are to blame.
  OTHELLO.                                Indeed!
    In one of those same sheets.
    In such gross kind?
  DESDEMONA.          In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
  EMILIA. In troth, I think I should, and undo't when I had done.
    Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
    In rage, deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.
    In the devotion of a subject's love,
    In name of lendings for your Highness' soldiers,
    In haste whereof, most heartily I pray
    In that I live, and for that will I die.
    In some large measure to thy father's death
    In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
    In suff'ring thus thy brother to be slaught'red,
  MARSHAL. In God's name and the King's, say who thou art,  
    In lists on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
    In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?
    In war was never lion rag'd more fierce,
    In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
    In him, a royal prince, and many moe
    In Brittany, receiv'd intelligence
    In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,
    In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
    In gross rebellion and detested treason.
    In braving arms against thy sovereign.
    In murders and in outrage boldly here;
    In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown;
    Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
    Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:
    In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,
    In the base court? Come down? Down, court! down, king!
    In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,
    In the remembrance of a weeping queen.                Exeunt
    In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted
    In this your cousin's death.
    In thy heart-blood, through being all too base
    In all this presence that hath mov'd me so.
    In this appeal as thou art an unjust;
    In earth as quiet as thy father's skull.
    In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
  BOLINGBROKE. In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.
    In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire
    Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there,
  BOLINGBROKE. Intended or committed was this fault?
    In humours like the people of this world,
    In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
    In London streets, that coronation-day,
    In weeping after this untimely bier.                  Exeunt
    In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
    Into this breathing world scarce half made up,
    In deadly hate the one against the other;
    Where is he? In his bed?
  ANNE. In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
  GREY. In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse;
  GLOUCESTER. In all which time you and your husband Grey
    In Margaret's battle at Saint Albans slain?  
    In sharing that which you have pill'd from me.
    In sign of league and amity with thee.
    Into the tumbling billows of the main.
    Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
  CLARENCE. In God's name, what art thou?
    In quarrel of the house of Lancaster.  
    Incapable and shallow innocents,
    In common worldly things 'tis called ungrateful
    In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
  SECOND CITIZEN. In him there is a hope of government,
    In him that did object the same to thee.
    Insulting tyranny begins to jet
    [Aside]  Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,  
    In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
    In the seat royal of this famous isle?
  HASTINGS. Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
    In God's name speak-when is the royal day?
  BISHOP OF ELY. In happy time, here comes the Duke himself.
    Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
    Intending deep suspicion. Ghastly looks
  GLOUCESTER. What! think you we are Turks or Infidels?
    Infer the bastardy of Edward's children.
    Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose
  BUCKINGHAM. The Mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear;
    In deep designs, in matter of great moment,
    In this just cause come I to move your Grace.
  GLOUCESTER. In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
    In your behalf, to meet you on the way.
    Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman,
  KING RICHARD. Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
    In her consists my happiness and thine;
  SECOND MESSENGER. In Kent, my liege, the Guilfords are in
    In your embowell'd bosoms-this foul swine
    In God's name cheerly on, courageous friends,
    In to my tent; the dew is raw and cold.  
    Into the blind cave of eternal night.           Exit CATESBY
    In brief, for so the season bids us be,
    In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
    In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
    Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
  RICHMOND. Inter their bodies as becomes their births.  
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
    I drew to part them. In the instant came
  Ben. In love?
    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
    In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
    Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,

  Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.
  Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.  
    In shape no bigger than an agate stone
    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
    In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;
    In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;
    In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
    In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.
    In my behalf- my reputation stain'd
    In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
    In such a gorgeous palace!
    In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
    In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
    In what vile part of this anatomy
    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
    In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
  Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied
    Evermore show'ring? In one little body
    In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
    In thy best robes uncovered on the bier
    In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,  
    In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed
    In this so sudden business.
    In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
    In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
    In all her best array bear her to church;
    In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,
    In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.  
    In what I farther shall intend to do,
  Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.

  SECOND LORD. In like manner was I in debt to my importunate
    Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,
    Into this sea of air.
    Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb-
    In purity of manhood stand upright,
    In my penurious band. I have heard, and griev'd,
    In the sick air; let not thy sword skip one.
    Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues,
    In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,
    In general riot, melted down thy youth
    In different beds of lust, and never learn'd
    In holier shapes; for there is boundless theft
    In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
    In pity of our aged and our youth-
    In their applauding gates.
    In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them-
    In our dear peril.

    In election for the Roman empery
    In coffins from the field; and at this day
    In thy uprightness and integrity,  
    In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;
    In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!

    In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.
    In readiness for Hymenaeus stand-
    In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.
    In zeal to you, and highly mov'd to wrath
    In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.
    Into this gaping hollow of the earth?
    In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.
    In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept;
    In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;
    In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow
    In bootless prayer have they been held up,
    In thy dumb action will I be as perfect
