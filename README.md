# Catalina Galan Vargas . Jarvis Consulting

I am a deeply curious individual and a dedicated lifelong learner. With a background in the arts and music, I earned my bachelor's degree in Music Composition, graduating with Great Distinction. In 2023 I successfully completed a Web Development bootcamp and have been continuing to learn and collaborate in projects ever since. Fascinated by both the arts and sciences, I continually seek opportunities to challenge my abilities and foster intellectual growth. My interest in software development stems from a strong desire to expand my knowledge and pursue a new, challenging career path. I am enthusiastic about the future of this journey and am eager to grow and excel in this industry.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_CatalinaGalan](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_CatalinaGalan)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_CatalinaGalan/tree/master/linux_sql)]: The Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent app is designed to record hardware specifications and usage information from multiple nodes in a Linux Cluster. It collects usage data from each node in real time and stores it in a RDBMS. The app was created for the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA), to manage a cluster of 10 nodes internally connected through a switch. The team needs to record information and track the usage of each machine in the network.

**RDBSM and SQL** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_CatalinaGalan/tree/master/sql)]: SQL (Structured Query Language) is a specialized language widely used when handling data. The objective of this project it to practice SQL and RDBMS by solving SQL queries.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_CatalinaGalan/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Grep App: This Java app mimics the functionality of the Linux command 'grep', which is used to search for a string or regex pattern within a file and returns all lines that contain the match. This app is designed to be run directly in the command line, outputting the results to a given file.
  - JDBC App: TBD


## Highlighted Projects
**Frontrow** [[GitHub](https://github.com/catagalan-mtl/frontrow-cat)]: Frontrow is a social platform where fans can find, rate and review concerts, as well as interact, follow and connect with other fans. This was the final team project at Le Wagon bootcamp. The app was deployed in Heroku and developed with Ruby on Rails in a two week Agile sprint. As a participant in this project I collaborated in building the back-end schema and databases with PostgreSQL; created front-end elements with SCSS and Stimulus; and implemented the chat feature in its entirety.

**My Portfolio** [[GitHub](https://github.com/catagalan-mtl/my-portfolio)]: This website was developed as a personal project to showcase my work. It is a fully responsive website built from a single page template and transformed into a rails app with a PostgreSQL database, deployed in Heroku. I have modified and restructured the original open source code to support my needs and preferences by: creating objects for each project and facilitating any update process; implementing a new custom design with CSS and Stimulus for JavaScript; and adding new features such as show pages and media for each project.
